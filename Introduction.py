#Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
#Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
#Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose
